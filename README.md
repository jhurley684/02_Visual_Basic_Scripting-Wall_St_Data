# VBA-challenge
This contains the Homework 2 assignment about WallStreet Data.

I completed first part of the assignment:
*  Ticker Symbol
*  Yearly Change - Positive in green, negative in red
*  Total stock volume 
*  Each in their own columns
*  All answers footed out correctly

Bonus
======================================================
I was also able to complete the Bonus work of providing "Greatest % increase",
"Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".  Each area footed out correctly.

My script ran successfully on every page.  In order for it to work on every page,
I had to create a process to solve a divide by 0 problem presented by some of the data 
(PLNT stock which had all zero numbers).

I also added headers, formated columns & some cells to make the summaries easier to read.
